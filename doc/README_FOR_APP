orGit --- a simple wiki powered by org-mode and git

- *org-mode* provides powerful formatting with export to HTML, LaTeX,
  and Sweave
- *git* provides version control, history and attribution

* COMMENT tasks [1/4]
Things to do

** TODO implement the backend for history view/diff/revert [0/3]
*** TODO view
*** TODO diff
*** TODO revert

** TODO configuration [0/2]
Setup a configuration page where it is possible to customize the wiki
for a particular repo.

*** TODO style and view options
*** TODO access for the repo
- who can view
- who can edit

** TODO Emacs interaction
Maybe should use Emacs-client rather than starting up a new emacs, or
could also use something more complicated but possibly preferable like
having a hanging dialog waiting to accept commands.

preference for the former

** MAYBE other formats aside from org [0/3]
maybe do some other backends like
*** TODO markdown
*** TODO textile
*** TODO source-code
