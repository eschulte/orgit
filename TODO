Things to do...

** DONE ActiveFile [1/1]
The active file paths are now working, thanks to two helpers in
ActiveFileHelpers

** DONE add repo git view
this could be modeled after magit
** DONE style [1/1]
*** DONE the git info page

** DONE use .gitignore to ignore certain files
- like those matching *~
maybe this shouldn't use .gitignore

Added a git.ignore?(rel_path) command in [[file:vendor/plugins/acts_as_git/lib/git_extensions.rb ][git_extensions.rb]], which
reads a repo's .gitignore file, and decides whether or not to ignore a
file appropriately.

** DONE commit on edit
** DONE add page action from :at and :view actions
add a new page to the repo, and begin editing it.

maybe good if you go to a page that doesn't exist.

** DONE implement the backend for history view/diff/revert [3/3]
*** DONE view
now showing the older version.

still need to add buttons when viewing the old revision to switch back
and forth between the html view and the raw body view.

*** DONE diff
*** DONE revert

** DONE update to new active_file version

** TODO stop using private git urls for submodules

** TODO replace view with show

** MAYBE configuration [0/2]
Setup a configuration page where it is possible to customize the wiki
for a particular repo.

*** TODO style and view options
*** TODO access for the repo
- who can view
- who can edit
** MAYBE Emacs interaction
Maybe should use Emacs-client rather than starting up a new emacs, or
could also use something more complicated but possibly preferable like
having a hanging dialog waiting to accept commands.

preference for the former

** MAYBE other formats aside from org [0/3]
maybe do some other backends like
*** TODO markdown
*** TODO textile
*** TODO source-code
