orGit --- a wiki powered by org-mode and git

- *org-mode* provides powerful formatting with export to HTML, LaTeX,
  and Sweave
- *git* provides version control, history and attribution

* COMMENT tasks [4/6]
Things to do

** DONE ActiveFile [1/1]
The active file paths are now working, thanks to two helpers in
ActiveFileHelpers

** DONE add repo git view
this could be modeled after magit

** TODO implement the backend for history view/diff/revert [2/3]
*** DONE view
now showing the older version.

still need to add buttons when viewing the old revision to switch back
and forth between the html view and the raw body view.

*** DONE diff
*** TODO revert

** TODO configuration [0/2]
Setup a configuration page where it is possible to customize the wiki
for a particular repo.

*** TODO style and view options
*** TODO access for the repo
- who can view
- who can edit

** MAYBE Emacs interaction
Maybe should use Emacs-client rather than starting up a new emacs, or
could also use something more complicated but possibly preferable like
having a hanging dialog waiting to accept commands.

preference for the former

** MAYBE other formats aside from org [0/3]
maybe do some other backends like
*** TODO markdown
*** TODO textile
*** TODO source-code
